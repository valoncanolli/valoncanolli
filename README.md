## 🔍 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity professional with years of hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and defending systems under pressure. From internal SOC operations to advanced threat hunting and malware analysis, I specialize in building both human and automated shields against adversaries. My passion is in **proactive defense**, **Red/Blue Team strategy**, and **turning intelligence into action**.

> 💬 “Attack like a Red Teamer, defend like a SOC Commander.”
